## Introduction

This Chess Engine uses the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm used for decision making in turn-based games. The algorithm works by simulating all possible game scenarios a few steps ahead and then making an optimal decision based on the simulation's outcome.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

* JavaScript ES6


## Features

* Real-time chess simulation with a computer player
* Decision-making powered by the Minimax algorithm
* Easy setup and execution
* Adjustable difficulty levels
